# LLM Pokemon Showdown Bot - Development Scratchpad

## Initial Analysis (2025-06-24)
- Read plan.md - comprehensive plan for building an LLM-powered Pokemon Showdown bot
- Architecture: Game Interface (poke-env) -> State Processor -> LLM Decision-Maker -> Action Executor
- Key technologies: Python, poke-env library, LLM API (like Gemini)
- Need to implement: prompt engineering, LLM integration, response parsing

## Questions to Address:
1. What LLM provider should we use? (plan mentions Gemini)
2. Do we need to set up local Pokemon Showdown server first?
3. What's the current state of the repository? (seems mostly empty)

## Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Install dependencies (poke-env)
- [ ] Create basic bot skeleton
- [ ] Implement state processor (prompt engineering)
- [ ] Integrate LLM API
- [ ] Add response parsing
- [ ] Test and iterate

## Repository Status:
- Currently contains: plan.md, scratchpad.md (just created)
- Empty repository, starting from scratch
- Created todo list with 7 main tasks

## Progress Log:
### Setup Phase:
- Created requirements.txt with poke-env, requests, python-dotenv, google-generativeai
- Created .env.example for configuration
- Created .gitignore for Python project
- Ready to create bot structure

### Bot Skeleton Phase:
- Created bot.py with LLMPlayer class structure
- Implemented basic choose_move method with placeholder functions
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Created main function for running the bot
- Placeholders ready for: state processor, LLM integration, response parser

### State Processor Phase:
- Created comprehensive state_processor.py module
- Implemented detailed prompt generation with:
  - Active Pokemon info (HP, stats, moves, status)
  - Opponent Pokemon info (known details)
  - Team composition and HP status
  - Field conditions (weather, terrain, hazards)
  - Available actions (moves and switches)
  - Strategic considerations and response format
- Updated bot.py to use StateProcessor
- Ready for LLM integration

### LLM Integration Phase:
- Created llm_client.py with support for Google Gemini API
- Implemented MockLLMClient for testing without API calls
- Added proper async handling and error management
- Configured generation parameters for better responses
- Updated bot.py to use LLM client

### Response Parser Phase:
- Created response_parser.py with robust parsing logic
- Implemented structured response parsing (action: move/switch format)
- Added fuzzy parsing for natural language responses  
- Included move/Pokemon name variation matching
- Added validation against available actions
- Proper fallback handling when parsing fails

### Testing Phase:
- Created test_bot.py for component testing
- Tests all major components individually
- Tests full pipeline integration
- Uses mock objects to avoid server dependency
- Fixed mock object issues and all tests now pass
- Installed poke-env and dependencies successfully

### Documentation Phase:
- Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Documented architecture, usage, and troubleshooting
- Added configuration examples and extension guidelines
- Created .env file for local development

## FINAL STATUS: PROJECT COMPLETE ✅

All components implemented and tested:
✅ Project structure and dependencies
✅ State processor with detailed prompt generation  
✅ LLM integration (Multiple providers + Mock client)
✅ Response parser with fuzzy matching
✅ Main LLMPlayer class integration
✅ Component testing suite
✅ Documentation and setup guides

### UPDATE: OpenAI API Support Added
- Modified llm_client.py to support any OpenAI-compatible API
- Supported providers:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Google Gemini (original)
  - Ollama (local models)
  - Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Updated configuration to use LLM_PROVIDER environment variable
- Updated documentation with examples for each provider

The bot is ready to run with:
- Mock LLM for testing: `python bot.py`
- Any supported LLM: Configure provider in .env file
