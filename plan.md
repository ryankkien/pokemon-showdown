# **Guideline and Plan: Building an LLM-Powered Pokémon Showdown Bot**

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to create a Pokémon Showdown bot that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for its decision-making process. We will cover the necessary technologies, the architectural design, and a step-by-step implementation guide.

## **1\. Introduction**

The goal is to develop a bot capable of playing Pokémon Showdown by feeding the game's state to an LLM and using its response to determine the next move. This approach leverages the advanced reasoning and pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs to create a more dynamic and potentially more strategic bot than one based on hardcoded rules or traditional algorithms.

## **2\. Core Technologies**

We will use the following technologies:

* **Pokémon Showdown:** A popular online Pokémon battle simulator that provides the environment for our bot.  
* **Python:** The programming language of choice for its extensive libraries and ease of use in AI and web-related projects.  
* **poke-env:** A powerful Python library that provides a high-level API for creating Pokémon Showdown agents. It handles the low-level communication with the Showdown server, allowing us to focus on the bot's logic.  
* **Large Language Model (LLM):** The "brain" of our bot. We will use a powerful LLM, such as Google's Gemini, to analyze the game state and suggest the best course of action. You will need to have access to an LLM through an API.

## **3\. High-Level Architecture**

The bot's architecture will be composed of four main components:

\+---------------------+      \+-----------------+      \+---------------------+      \+----------------+  
|                     |      |                 |      |                     |      |                |  
|  Game Interface     \+-----\>+ State Processor \+-----\>+  LLM Decision-Maker \+-----\>+ Action         |  
|  (poke-env)         |      |                 |      |                     |      | Executor       |  
|                     |      |                 |      |                     |      |                |  
\+---------------------+      \+-----------------+      \+---------------------+      \+----------------+  
      ^                                                                                  |  
      |                                                                                  |  
      \+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+  
                                        (Game Actions)

* **Game Interface (poke-env):** This component connects to the Pokémon Showdown server, manages the battle, and receives real-time updates on the game state.  
* **State Processor:** This module takes the raw Battle object provided by poke-env and translates it into a human-readable text prompt that can be understood by the LLM. This is a crucial step that involves "prompt engineering."  
* **LLM Decision-Maker:** This is the core of our bot. It sends the formatted prompt to the LLM and receives a suggested move in return.  
* **Action Executor:** This component parses the LLM's response, validates the suggested move, and sends the corresponding action back to the game through the poke-env interface.

## **4\. Implementation Plan**

Here is a step-by-step plan to build the bot:

### **Step 1: Setup and Installation**

1. **Install Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.  
2. **Install poke-env:**  
   pip install poke-env

3. **Set up a local Pokémon Showdown server (recommended for development):**  
   git clone https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown.git  
   cd pokemon-showdown  
   npm install  
   node pokemon-showdown start \--no-security

   Running a local server avoids rate limits and allows for faster testing.

### **Step 2: Create a Basic poke-env Bot**

Start by creating a simple bot that connects to your local server and makes random moves. This will verify that your setup is working correctly. The poke-env documentation provides excellent examples to get started.

### **Step 3: State Extraction and Prompt Engineering**

This is the most critical part of the project. You need to create a function that converts the Battle object from poke-env into a detailed prompt for the LLM. The more comprehensive and well-structured the prompt, the better the LLM's decisions will be.

**Example of a well-structured prompt:**

You are a master Pokémon strategist. Your goal is to win this Pokémon battle.  
Here is the current state of the battle:

\*\*Your Active Pokémon:\*\*  
\- Charizard (Level 100, Male, HP: 85/100, Status: None)  
  \- Type: Fire/Flying  
  \- Abilities: Blaze  
  \- Stats: {atk: 200, def: 180, spa: 250, spd: 190, spe: 230}  
  \- Moves:  
    1\. Flamethrower (Fire, Special, 90 Power)  
    2\. Solar Beam (Grass, Special, 120 Power)  
    3\. Focus Blast (Fighting, Special, 120 Power)  
    4\. Roost (Flying, Status)

\*\*Opponent's Active Pokémon:\*\*  
\- Blastoise (Level 100, Male, HP: 70/100, Status: None)  
  \- Type: Water  
  \- Abilities: Torrent  
  \- Stats: {atk: 180, def: 230, spa: 190, spd: 240, spe: 180}

\*\*Your Bench:\*\*  
\- Venusaur (HP: 100/100)  
\- Pikachu (HP: 100/100)  
\- Snorlax (HP: 100/100)  
\- Gengar (HP: 100/100)  
\- Dragonite (HP: 100/100)

\*\*Opponent's Bench (Known):\*\*  
\- (Opponent has 5 more Pokémon)

\*\*Battle Log (Last 2 Turns):\*\*  
\- Turn 3: You used Flamethrower. It was super effective\!  
\- Turn 4: Opponent used Hydro Pump.

Based on this information, what is the best move to make?  
You can choose to use a move or switch to another Pokémon.  
Your available moves are: Flamethrower, Solar Beam, Focus Blast, Roost.  
Your available switches are: Venusaur, Pikachu, Snorlax, Gengar, Dragonite.  
Please provide your choice in the format: \`action: "move" or "switch", value: "move name" or "pokémon name"\`.

### **Step 4: LLM Integration**

You will need to use an LLM API to send the prompt and receive a response. Here is a conceptual example using Python's requests library to call a hypothetical LLM API:

import requests  
import json

def get\_llm\_decision(prompt):  
    api\_key \= "YOUR\_LLM\_API\_KEY"  
    url \= "LLM\_API\_ENDPOINT"

    headers \= {  
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api\_key}",  
        "Content-Type": "application/json",  
    }

    data \= {  
        "prompt": prompt,  
        "max\_tokens": 50,  
    }

    response \= requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))  
    \# Process the response to extract the move  
    return response.json()

### **Step 5: Parsing the LLM's Output**

The LLM's response will be in natural language. You need to parse this response to extract the chosen action (move or switch) and the corresponding value (move name or Pokémon name). It is a good idea to ask the LLM to format its output in a specific way (as shown in the prompt example) to make parsing easier. You should also include error handling to gracefully manage cases where the LLM provides an invalid or nonsensical move.

### **Step 6: Putting It All Together**

Integrate the LLM's decision-making process into your bot's main loop. The choose\_move method in your poke-env player class is the perfect place for this.

from poke\_env.player import Player

class LLMPlayer(Player):  
    def choose\_move(self, battle):  
        \# 1\. Generate the prompt from the battle state  
        prompt \= self.create\_prompt(battle)

        \# 2\. Get the decision from the LLM  
        llm\_response \= get\_llm\_decision(prompt)

        \# 3\. Parse the LLM's response  
        action, value \= self.parse\_llm\_response(llm\_response, battle)

        \# 4\. Execute the chosen move  
        if action \== "move":  
            return self.create\_order(value)  
        elif action \== "switch":  
            return self.create\_order(value)

        \# Fallback to a random move if something goes wrong  
        return self.choose\_random\_move(battle)

## **5\. Advanced Considerations**

* **Prompt Refinement:** Continuously improve your prompt to provide the LLM with more context. You can include information about type effectiveness, move descriptions, field conditions, and the history of the battle.  
* **Constraining the LLM:** To prevent the LLM from making illegal moves, you can give it a list of valid moves and ask it to choose from that list.  
* **Performance:** LLM API calls can be slow. You may need to manage your time effectively, especially when playing against human opponents. Consider using a faster, less powerful model for simpler decisions.  
* **Cost:** Be mindful of the cost of using a commercial LLM API. Set a budget and monitor your usage.

## **6\. Conclusion**

Building an LLM-powered Pokémon Showdown bot is a challenging but rewarding project that combines game theory, AI, and software engineering. By following this plan, you will be able to create a sophisticated bot that can make intelligent decisions in the complex world of competitive Pokémon.
